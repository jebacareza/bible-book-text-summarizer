Greek mythology to contemporary American places and values. Anyone around 15 (give or take a couple of years) will thrill to the visual spectacle\n","Uma Thurman as Medusa, the gorgon with a coiffure of writhing snakes and stone-inducing hypnotic gaze is one of the highlights of this bewitching fantasy\n","With a top-notch cast and dazzling special effects, this will tide the teens over until the next Harry Potter instalment.\n","Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?\n","What's really lacking in The Lightning Thief is a genuine sense of wonder, the same thing that brings viewers back to Hogwarts over and over again.\n","It's more a list of ingredients than a movie-magic potion to enjoy from start to finish.\n","Harry Potter knockoffs don't come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabe-franchise jumpstarter directed by Chris Columbus.\n","Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references.\n","Fun, brisk and imaginative\n","Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display.\n","This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic.\n","For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one.\n","Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan.\n","The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more.\n","This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.\n","Percy Jackson may not be \"Harry Potter good,\" but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a moviethey can bring them to that's family-friendly.\n","[P]erfectly inoffensive, occasionally clever... It's in the few genuinely cinematically joyful moments, the ones that do rise above the formula, that you realize how much more this could have been...\n","Admirably, the movie isn't bogged down in the exposition common to first entries, but at the end, it's a franchise searching for its voice.\n","The main thing this movie seems to be missing is classically trained British actors.\n","When the movie slows down to catch its breath, there's very little of the heart and soul -- and wry wit -- that make the Riordan books so beloved.\n"]}],"source":["for review in reviews.Text[0:20]:\n","
